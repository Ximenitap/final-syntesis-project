<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.
</p>
<div id="analysis1Plot1"></div>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can notice that the line goes its way up, it has a relation of proportion that is direct, that means that when one goes up, the other goes up too. So it seems like we are consuming  more month by month. That is called a proportionally direc relationship of the linear regression.</li>
  <li>The dots are very close to the linear regression. They don't have too much distance from one another. That can be interpreted as that the estimations that can be deduced are likely to be true and accurate. The red dots follow a tendency closely.</li>
  <li>
    For next month I will consume 545.7 kWh
    $$ y = 65.9 \cdot 6 + 150.3 $$
    $$ y = 545.7 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    I say we have such high values beacuse we keep our chargers connected for a long time, also we waste energy in the kitchen within the lights and household appliances that we use a lot. Sometimes we should turn off the lights while we don't use them and disconnect the chargers.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
<div id="analysis1Plot2"></div>
<p id="analysis1Eqn2" style="text-align: center;"></p>
<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>This chart's regression also has a positive linear output. As the number of residents grows the per month kWh also does. It is called a proportionally direct relationship and the slope is very high so the line has an important inclination.</li>
  <li>The red dots also seem to be very accurate in relation with the linear regression. They don't drift apart in big amounts and are fair to the tendency. So a result can be predicted very precisely and the equation is very likely to give true results.</li>
  <li>
    In a unit with 200 people it will be consumed 10259.37 kWh $$ y = 51.35 \cdot 200 -10.63$$ $$ y =  10259.37$$
  </li>
  <li>
    It is true that, as the residential unit has more people, more energy has to be provided suply people's needs. So it is really matching with the real results. And as shown in the last point if the first variable keeps on growing even inmensurably, the other one also increases a lot.
  </li>
</ul>
