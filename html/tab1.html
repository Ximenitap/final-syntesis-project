  <li>Scatter plot</li>
  <p>
    Uses dots to represent values for two different numeric variables. The
    position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values
    for an individual data point. Scatter plots are used to observe
    relationships between variables

  <li>Linear regression</li>
  <p>
    Is used to predict the value of a variable based on the value of another
    variable. The variable you want to predict is called the dependent variable.
    The variable you are using to predict the other variables value is called
    the independent variable.

  <li>Renewable energy</li>
  <p>
    Is energy derived from natural sources that are replenished at higher rate
    than they're consumed. Sunlight and wind, for example, are such sources that
    are constantly being replenished. Renewable energy sources are plentiful and
    all around us.
