<h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
<p>
  This second part of the project must be done individual. For each plot, you
  must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your
  information is true.

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
 According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>It is a linear regression with a big pendant, its inclination shows there is a positive proportionally direct relationship between the variables. That means that it is expected for next months that the outcome of kWh is bigger each time. It keeps on growing and increasing mainly because the last month had the highest of the consumptions.</li>
  <li>The first two dots are in line and follow exactly the linear regression. It is just the other ones that get a bit away, but not that much, so you could say the predictions are mostly valid as the relationship is not so disperse. The dots tend to behave as the equation estimates. </li>
  <li>
    For next month I will consume 226.8 kWh
    $$ y = 12 \cdot 6 + 226.8 $$
    $$ y = 226.8 $$
  </li>
  <li>
    A conclusion about your own interpretation on how you should reduce or
    remain stable the consumption of electric energy.

<h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>

<h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
<p>
  According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic
  displays that behavior in terms of:
</p>
<ul>

 <li>This chart's regression also has a positive linear output. As the number of residents grows the per month kWh also does. It is called a proportionally direct relationship and the slope is very high so the line has an important inclination.</li>
  <li>The red dots also seem to be very accurate in relation with the linear regression. They don't drift apart in big amounts and are fair to the tendency. So a result can be predicted very precisely and the equation is very likely to give true results.</li>
 
  <li>
    In a unit with 200 people it will be consumed 13511.3 kWh $$ y = 67.79 \cdot 200 -46.7$$ $$ y =  13511.3$$
  </li>
  <li>
   It is true that, as the residential unit has more people, more energy has to be provided suply people's needs. So it is really matching with the real results. And as shown in the last point if the first variable keeps on growing even inmensurably, the other one also increases a lot.
  </li>
</ul>
