    <h4>Linear regression: kWh vs Month</h4>
    <p>This second part of the project must be done individual.
      For each plot, you must show evidence about your bill house public services to proof that your information is true.
    </p>
    <div id="analysis3Plot1"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn1" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    
      <ul>
            <li>You can see in the the grapgh that the linear regression is decreasing in function of time by months. That means that it should follow the behavior that as each month passes, the kWh consumption is expected to be lower than before. It is decreasing in inverse proportion.</li>
            <li>As you can see the dots are very disperse, they are not close to the line of regression so the relationship is not very accurate. But still the linear regression shows a point almost in common with the first true value. As they go too far it would be hard to predict a precise value for next months.</li>
            <li>The energy I will consume on the next month can be predicted by the equation :
            $$ y= -1.2 \cdot 6 + 102.6 $$ $$ y = 95.4 $$</li>
            <li>It is always better to lower the consumption each time but I think it is enough and fair to keep the tnedency as it is because it is quite low. I can keep on doing that in my house because me and my mom do not stay too much time at home because of work and study. So we keep light off and cables not conneccted. </li>
      </ul>
    <h4>Linear regression: Residents vs kWh</h4>
    <div id="analysis3Plot2"></div>
    <p id="analysis3Eqn2" style="text-align: center"></p>
    <h5>About the observed behavior</h5>
    <p>According to the collected data from the plot, explain why the graphic displays that behavior in terms of:
    </p>
    <ul>
         <li>The increasement and decreasement of the regression.</li>
         <li>Most of the dots are very accure with the line that represents it, as they don't drift apart too much from the line</li>
         <li>Estimate how many energy will be consumed in a residential unit where $200$ people live. Use LaTeX syntax in order to compute that.</li>
         <li>A conclusion about your own interpretation on why is given that relation between these two variables.</li>
      </ul>
